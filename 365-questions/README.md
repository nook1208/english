## Q11 : Do you think crying is a sign of weakness or strength?

The crying is just result of emotion. It doesn't mean strength or weakness. I don't crying a lot. But it doesn't mean that I'm a strong person. In my opinion, if you want to see who is the strong person or weak person, you see the value or thinking method of the person. For example, if a student who is so poor that he have to part-time job for living still hold his dream and try to keep moving on, He is a strong person.

## Q12 : What would you do differently if you knew nobody would judge you?

If someone don't judge me, I'd feel more comfortable instead of changing my behave.
I tend to be quite afraid of receiving bad reviews from others, and it's like an instinct. I try hard not to think like that, and I know that other people are not interested in me unexpectedly, but it is not easy to get rid of these thoughts forever. However, there are good things about these things. This is because people sometimes develop themselves more thanks to their desire to look good to others.

## Q13 : Do you celebrate the things you do have?

Yes I do. My parents are still alive and I'm really healthy. Fortunately, I was able to achieve some my goals through my effort and thanks to luck. And I could meet really good wife when I was a university student. These things are really precious to me. But I ususally tend to forgot these things living my life. So I think the habits to looking back on myself is important.
