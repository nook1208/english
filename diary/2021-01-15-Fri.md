I found another friend in hellow talk. 
I don't know yet how fluent he could speak Korean. I hope that he has a passion to learn Korean. It's not an important thing when I communicate in English, but just I want a person that I can give feedback in Korean. I think that's a really language exchange friend, isn't it?

Also, He said he is a SW engineer. That sounds interesting. I wanna know what kinds of program does he writing, and what's language does he use. If he is an embedded engineer, It'd be better, But that's okay. 

Btw, Today is Friday...yeah! Party people~
Also, Today is the 1500 day after I met my girlfriend. I have to think about the dinner menu. It's a kind of pleasant worry. I hope that there is no problem at my work. Because I wanna go home as soon as possible.
