I have to prepare the next time voice call. 
So, let's think about my Philippines travel.
As I mentioned to Dojoon, I had a vacation in Cebu and Bohol 3 years ago. 

I remember the taste of beer was extra good. But I can't remember what's the beer's name. 
Maybe.. tiger?

I thought the travel was really happier than other travel. Because I went to travel after I got the job. Also, It was my second travel abroad with my girlfriend So, we were really excited.

Let me tell you about the things I remember. First of all, the mango was amazing. Especially mango in Bohol was crazy. We bought them every day and ate them all.

Also, we had an Oslob whale shark watching tour. We saw the whale shark and they were so huge. I had a little horrible episode. When I was seeing them, a one whale shark was coming to me from the bottom of the sea. And he hit my right shoulder and went to the surface of the sea. He was drawing in the seawater.

So I could touch him, and his skin was really hard like a stone. That was a really interesting memory.
