Hello? 

Oh, No, It's okay. Becuase I was always late. haha.

I see. Your time was 8pm right ?

So you didn't have much sleep last night, did you ?

Okay, if you ever want to change our call schedule, you can just tell me. It's okay.

So.. how are you? 

As you mentioned, the Chinese new year is also a holiday in the Philippines. right ?

Me either. Korea has a holiday on Friday next week. And many people usually go to their parents' house.

Oh yeah, I'll go to my parents' home next thursday.

Yup, next thursday and Friday are holiday in Korea. In Philippines, is Friday the only holiday?

Oh I didn't know that.

But it's good. Because you have one more holiday.

Did you mean 'busy' as in you were busy because of your work?

In my understanding, you had a lot of things to do for that holiday. 

So, How about this week?

Space Sweeper?

Oh I don't know that movie.

The Space Sweeper is a movie in Netflix, right ?

In Korea That movie is called 승리호. So I didn't know that movie's English name.

What does 'Space Sweeper' mean ?

Like um.. cleaner? I see.

How about the movie?

You mean that movie is really good, right? 

How long is the movie play time?

Actually, I watched the movie with my parents yesterday and the play time was really long.

The movie title is Zodiac. Do you know that movie? It's really famous.

It's an American movie I think. And there are really famous actors in it such as Robert Downey Jr, Mark Ruffalo and Jake Gyllenhaal.

Did you look it up?

That movie runs two hours and a half hours long. That's really long.

Eight hours? What kinds of movies run for eight hours?

Is that movie on Netflix?

I see. Eight hours, wow.. that's really long.

I saw that movie's trailier, and I remember there were so many special effect. 
So I was curious how Netflix can make a movie like Space Sweeper. Because It seems to be a rather expensive movie. 

Btw, this week, I had a lot of interesting things.

We bought a Nintendo switch. Do you know that game console?

Oh really? I don't know whether my console is light version or not.

So, my console is version two. I can separate both sides of the console. It's amazing.

Actually this console is not mine. It was for my girlfriend's parents. My girlfriend bought this console and another console called Ringfit. Because her parents had to work out to get some muscle and lose some weight. 

But they didn't. So the game console had not been in use until we brought them to our house. So we tried to start playing the game called Legend of Zelda. Do you know the game?

Oh I see. We were playing that game right until this voice call.

We just played for an hour. But it was really fun. I recommend that game.

The fun part is my girlfriend was really scared whenever a monster comes out and so she gives the controller to me. And I get to kill a lot of monsters. After that, I'd return the controller to my girlfriend again. haha.

So, the first thing is that I bought the game console. And the second thing is that my girlfriend might start a business.

There is a house which have a lot of cats. And that house owner is a friend of my house owner.
So my girlfriend can got closer to the cat house owner. She went to the house every day.

One day, the house owner asked my girlfriend to start a business. It's about the cat house. 
The owner have been thinking to start a cat cafe or a library business. 
And my girlfriend really love cats, so she said yes. I don' know how the things will go, but it's interesting. So I told my girlfriend "It's okay, give it a try".

I love cats and dogs but I love dogs more. I really want to raise a dog, but It's hard to do that.
Because I and my girlfriend have to work every week day, So there are so many moments when nobody is at home. If I raise a dog, It would be so sad when left alone.
