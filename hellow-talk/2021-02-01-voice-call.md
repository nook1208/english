Hi

By the way, sorry for canceling last week's voice call. 

Because I had to choose where we will stay for our honeymoon.

Oh.. honeymoon 

Honeymoon means the trip after the wedding, right? 

Oh, thank you!

So we selected three places for our honeymoon. 
and we spent a lot of time to checking out those places.

Define? 

Define yeah, select.

Oh, thank you.

Did you have dinner?

Oh, why did you skip your dinner?

Wow really?

This month? So you started it today? 

Wow, I think you're really hungry. Am I right?

When I saw your profile picture, you didn't look fat.

When I was a high school student, I was really fat. I was over 100 kilograms. So I know that skipping a meal could be really tough. 
So It's going to work.

How about doing home training? instead of skipping meals.

I think it's nice. You are working out at home and controlling your eating habits. It's gonna be work.

How can I translate "힘내세요"?

Cheer up and you can do it? Thank you.

I had my meal before this conversation.

I ate pigs' feet. 

What does it mean 'pork cuts'?

That means so many parts of pigs right?

tenderloin? Oh that means 안심

I mean.. hmm.. It's hard to explain.

That's part of the pig and it's tender meat.

So, I ate pork legs with rice. Also, I cooked a simple dish.

Yeah, I love cooking.

In Korea, there are a lot of people who love cooking. I mean, male. 
And my friends love cooking too.
But he is better than me. Because he uses various types of cooking utensils such as an oven and a steamer.

Do you like cooking?

That's nice. When I go to my parent's house, My mother used to cook. So I can have more free time. 

Not really. When I go to work, the company provides food for every meal.

But I usually have dinner with my girlfriend at home. 

Cooking is good but there is a little problem.
Cooking uses up my time. So on weekdays, I only cook simple dishes. On weekends, I can cook something that requires more time such as steaks or stew.
