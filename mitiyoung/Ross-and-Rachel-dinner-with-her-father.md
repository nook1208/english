# Ross and Rachel dinner with her father

Okay daddy, we'll see you tomorrow night. Okay bye-bye.

We?

Are.. having the dinner with my dad tomorrow night. I hope that's okay.

Oh shoot, tomorrow is not so good. 
I'm supposed to fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. 

Ross, my father doesn't hate you. 

Oh please, he refers to me as 'wet-head'.

Look, He calls everybody by a nickname.

Okay just one dinner all right? Just one night for me plz?

I just want him to love you like I do.

Okay not exactly like i do. But if you come to dinner, i love you like i do in that black thing that you like.

I'll go

Fine

Thank you

Hi gunther

Hi daddy!

This is where they put it? what, there is no table available in the kitchen?

Hello baby

You remember Ross?

Nice to see you again doctor green!

So, how's the library?

Museum.

What happened to the library

There never was library. 
I mean, there are libraries. It's just that i never worked at one

You know what's really good here? The lobster. What do you say, shall i just order 3?

Yeah if you're really hungry.
It was a joke, i made a joke.

Actually dad, Ross is allergic to lobster.

what kind of person is allergic to lobster. i guess the kind of person that works at a library.

It's not a library..
I know it's a museum!

What, Do you think you're the only one around here who can make a joke?. At least mine was funny. Waiter, we will have lobsters and a menu.
