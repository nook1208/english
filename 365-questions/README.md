## Q11. Do you think crying is a sign of weakness or strength?

The crying is just result of emotion. It doesn't mean strength or weakness. I don't crying a lot. But it doesn't mean that I'm a strong person. In my opinion, if you want to see who is the strong person or weak person, you see the value or thinking method of the person. For example, if a student who is so poor that he have to part-time job for living still hold his dream and try to keep moving on, He is a strong person.

## Q12. What would you do differently if you knew nobody would judge you?

If someone don't judge me, I'd feel more comfortable instead of changing my behave.
I tend to be quite afraid of receiving bad reviews from others, and it's like an instinct. I try hard not to think like that, and I know that other people are not interested in me unexpectedly, but it is not easy to get rid of these thoughts forever. However, there are good things about these things. This is because people sometimes develop themselves more thanks to their desire to look good to others.

## Q13. Do you celebrate the things you do have?

Yes I do. My parents are still alive and I'm really healthy. Fortunately, I was able to achieve some my goals through my effort and thanks to luck. And I could meet really good wife when I was a university student. These things are really precious to me. But I ususally tend to forgot these things living my life. So I think the habits to looking back on myself is important.

## Q15. If not now, then when?

Maybe the author of this question intend to critisize the person who delay their jobs. Because it's true to many people.  So do I. I delay my works which I have to do in many cases. Let me explain why. If I don't have enough time, I usually delay my works to take a rest for my happiness and mental health. But I always finish the most important thing by raising the priority of the work. This habit makes me to do a one thing that is really important

## Q16. Have you done anything lately worth remembering?

Yes I have. A few days ago, I made invitation for my wedding with my girlfriend. Also I met my friends to gave the invitation. They were my university friends and we met in the algorithm club that I made.
When I was a student, I made a algorithm club with my friends. So I used to teaching algorithm and problem solving methods to my juniors. They were my juniors and time goes by, they got a job.
It was so good to meet them. Plus, I bought tailor-made suits to my father and my brother. It was so proud that I could do it for them.

## Q17. What does your joy look like today?
I used to analyze some stocks these days. It was really fun. When I was reading a book about stocks, It became a little bit bored. 
But I analyzed stocks with what I studied,  It was more interesting than reading comic books and It was hard to resist the desire to invest right away.
I finish reading the book recently, So I'm now able to analyze stocks. Of course I used to do while reading a book. But now I can send my a lot of time to analyzing it.
So I'm finding and analyzing stocks whenever I can. Also, I investing to it when I feel that this is a good chance. 
Actually, I had profit by investing a stock that was soaring at that time. But the profit was really low because I just invested a small amount of money. 
As I mentioned, the stock was soaring and I felt that was bubble. So I bought that stock and then put selling order. 
This is the first time that I invested to dangerous stock. But It was quite interesting.

## Q19. If you had a friend who spoke to you in the same way that you sometimes speak to yourself, how long would you allow this person to be your friend?
I think people don't like person who are similar to themselves unconsciously.
 I haven't thought about it deeply, maybe It's because they know what the emotion are hidden in other's behave or words.
For example, there are some moments that they object to other's opinions which are somewhat correct but they don't want to acknowledge.
So if someone object to my opinion, maybe I feel a little bad. Because I know what emotions are hidden behind that objections.
But actually, it's really hard title to discuss. Because I don't know why I feel not good sometimes when I saw a person who is really similar to myself.

## Q20. Which activities make you lose track of time?
There are so many interesting things in the world. The games are especially fun. When I playing Jelda using my nintendo switch, the excitement and addictiveness are so big that I fall into the game. I don't have TV at my home now. If I had it, my game play time would be longer than now. The passage of time are so different by places that I used to spend my time. If I work at my office, the times would be goes by slowly. When I blink my eyes while playing games, my time run away from me. Also, I have one more things that I used to spend my times. It's stock. Although Study the stocks reading books is little bit boaring, my times goes by fastly. But if I see a chart of my stocks, I couldn't notice passage of time. Because I have a lot of things to thinking. For example, I have to think when to buy or sell. Also I should check my principle of investment watching past data.

## Q21. If you had to teach something, what would you teach?
I'm realizing the economy and financial knowledge are important things in life. But the most important thing is upright character. 
Even If I'm rich and also if I have a bad character, I wouldn't have anyone, friends, family. That's horrible and there is no meaning in my life.
So If I end my life, that's not strange. Because man is a social animal, we have to develop our character in the right direction. 
Actually, If we don't live with someone else forever, we don't have to develop our personality. However we have to live with other people and it's better for themselves.

## Q22. What would you regret not fully doing, being or having in your life?
I sometimes regret that I didn't think about my career when I was an elementary school student. Of course, that age is too young to even think about it. But It's still sad.
I started to studying hard when I was 19 years old. Because I want to go to the university. I think It was very late to go to the good university. It's also regretful memory too.
But there are also good things that I gained from the experience. I always try to look forward to prepare my future. So I can get a good score in my university and get a job before I graduate. 
I think there are always pros and cons to everything.
