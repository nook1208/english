I've been practicing my English skill.
Especially, Listening and Speaking. I don't know what's the best way to learn those skills.   
Now, I've been writing diaries and communicate Hello talk's friend for my writing skill.   
For my Speaking skill, I have a voice call with my Hello talk friend every week.  
Plus I used to speak myself  silently about anything. 
Plus, I used to listen to my friend when they speak for my listening skill. 

With those things, I'm still not sure if It's enough to learn English. I thought that's because of my greed. I wanna be the one who can speak English really well as soon as possible. Also, I used to have a meeting with global partners. I really want to hear all of the sentences they speak and speak them fluently.
