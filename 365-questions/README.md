## Q11. Do you think crying is a sign of weakness or strength?

The crying is just result of emotion. It doesn't mean strength or weakness. I don't crying a lot. But it doesn't mean that I'm a strong person. In my opinion, if you want to see who is the strong person or weak person, you see the value or thinking method of the person. For example, if a student who is so poor that he have to part-time job for living still hold his dream and try to keep moving on, He is a strong person.

## Q12. What would you do differently if you knew nobody would judge you?

If someone don't judge me, I'd feel more comfortable instead of changing my behave.
I tend to be quite afraid of receiving bad reviews from others, and it's like an instinct. I try hard not to think like that, and I know that other people are not interested in me unexpectedly, but it is not easy to get rid of these thoughts forever. However, there are good things about these things. This is because people sometimes develop themselves more thanks to their desire to look good to others.

## Q13. Do you celebrate the things you do have?

Yes I do. My parents are still alive and I'm really healthy. Fortunately, I was able to achieve some my goals through my effort and thanks to luck. And I could meet really good wife when I was a university student. These things are really precious to me. But I ususally tend to forgot these things living my life. So I think the habits to looking back on myself is important.

## Q15. If not now, then when?

Maybe the author of this question intend to critisize the person who delay their jobs. Because it's true to many people.Â  So do I. I delay my works which I have to do in many cases. Let me explain why. If I don't have enough time, I usually delay my works to take a rest for my happiness and mental health. But I always finish the most important thing by raising the priority of the work. This habit makes me to do a one thing that is really important

## Q16. Have you done anything lately worth remembering?

Yes I have. A few days ago, I made invitation for my wedding with my girlfriend. Also I met my friends to gave the invitation. They were my university friends and we met in the algorithm club that I made.
When I was a student, I made a algorithm club with my friends. So I used to teaching algorithm and problem solving methods to my juniors. They were my juniors and time goes by, they got a job.
It was so good to meet them. Plus, I bought tailor-made suits to my father and my brother. It was so proud that I could do it for them.
