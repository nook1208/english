I had a voice call with dojoon last night.
He could speak Korean very well. That was a little surprising. 
Compared to that, I was really bad at English.
It was really hard to make a sentence in English. I needed a lot of time to do it.

So I plan to figure out this situation. 
First, I'll write a diary in English. I think the main problem is making a sentence myself. Thus writing a diary is gonna be helpful.
Second, Speak today's diary without the diary Note. 
Third, We decided to set the topic and prepare it in advance. So the next topic is travel.

I suggested a trip for the next time topic to him.
And he said, "you mean travel right?".
So I thought the trip may not mean only the travel.
When I search for the trip's mean, There are two different means. One is travel, the other is a hallucination experience...
