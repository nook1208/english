hi what have you guys been up to?

We got a self-defend class today
→Went to, defense

Kicking a guy in the crotch all morning takes it out of you

Takes it out of you huh?

now we can kick anybody's ass

After one class? I don't think so

do you wanna see me self-defend myself?

go over there and pretend you're a sexual predator. Go on! I dare you

You can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming

I studied kara-te for a long time. There is a state What the japanese call unagi

Is not a kinds of sushi?

yeah it is, it is, it's a freshwater ell.

Well maybe it means that too.

Oh i would kill for a salmon skin roll right now

okay get attack, i don't even care

okay ross we're sorry. Please tell us what it is.

Unagi is the state of total awareness.
only by achieving a true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you.

you mean, in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?

All i'm saying is,  it's one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other, whole other story being prepared for an attack. I don't know .. surprise!

You knew that one was coming
But that doesn't mean you have unagi.

If we made a reservation, we could have unagi in about a half hour.

Danger!

What the hell was that?

a lesson in the importance of unagi

You're a freak!

Perhaps, but i'm curious, at what point during those girlish screems, would you have begun to kick my ass?

all right so we weren't prerpared!

i'm sorry that i had to take such drastic measures to make my point. i just want you guys to be safe.

Ahh~ unagi!

Danger!

Ahh~ salmon skin roll

Phoebe definitely. You'll not find a single game show host who's ass i cannot kick.

It's not something you are.
It's something you have

Say it!

I can easily get out of this. But There is a chance you can get very very hurt!
