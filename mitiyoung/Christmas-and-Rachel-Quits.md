# Christmas and Rachel Quits
And when you have second later, I wanna show you why we don't trap spiders under the coffee mugs and leave them there. 

I'm training to be better at a job that I hate. My life officially sucks.

Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you want to do fashion stuff.

Well yeah! I'm still pursuing that.

How exactly are you pursuing that? 

Other than sending out a resumes like what, two years ago? 

Well, I'm also sending out good thoughts

If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you have nothing pushing you to get another one.
You need the fear!

The fear?

That's right, If you quit this job, then you have motivation to go after a job you really want.

Well then, how come you are still at a job that you hate? Why don't you quit and get the fear?

Because I'm too afraid.

I would give anything work for a designer or a buyer. I don't want to be 30 and still work here.

That'd be much worse than being 28 and still work here.

Rachel?

Yeah

Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.

Can't I just look at the handles on them?

You would think.

Okay gunther? Do you know why I'm a terrible waitress? Because I don't care. I don't care which pot is regular, which pot is decaf. I don't care where the tray spot is. I don't think this is what I want to do. I'm gonna give you my week's notice. 

What?

Gunther I quit.

Hey how'd the interview go ?

I blew it. I wouldn't even hire me. 

Come on sweetie, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job.

That's not how that was supposed to come out.

You know what Rachel, maybe you should just stay here at a coffee house.

I can't ! Gunther already hired that girl over there. She's even got waitress experience. Last night, she was teaching everybody how to make napkin into swans.

That word is swans.

Well, seeing that drunk santa wet himself really perked up my christmas.

Oh, Oh my God !

Merry Christmas !

You guys ! You save them ! Oh God, you're the best !

It's like "Night of Living Dead Christmas Trees"

Hello ? Yeah, This is she. Are you kidding ? Oh my God, Thank you. I love you !!

Sure, everybody loves a kidder. 

I got the job !!

That's great ! Hey! Excellent !

Oh, God bless us, everyone !

Here we go, I serving my last cup of coffee. there you go, enjoy.

Should I tell her I ordered tee ?

Excuse me everyone, This is my last night working here.  I just wanted to say that I made some really good friends here, and it's time to move on. And no offense to everyone who still works here, but you have no idea how good it feels to say that as of this moment, I'll never have to make coffee again.

Now Mr.Kaplan Sr, likes his coffee strong. So you're gonna use two bags instead of one. Now pay attention, Cause this part is tricky. some people use filters just once.
