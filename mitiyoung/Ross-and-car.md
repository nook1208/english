That was a brisk ride

Take the top down did you?

Only way to fly

hey ross give me the keys, 
monica does not know what she is talking about. I'm a best driver

you are fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver

Well, in high school, that adds up to head cheerleader

Oh Did you see the look that girls gave me?
She must have seen me cruising in the bad boy


I think she is checking out your beehive, ross

What? Give me the brush

Give me the keys

No way

Well no brush

Fine, you know what? It doesn't matter. if i rememeber correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.

What do you think you are doing?

just washing the windsheild

there is no way i'm letting you drive this car. So why don't you hand over the keys? Don't start this car. I'll give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now!

Look ross , if you are so freaked out just get in the car

With you? yeah right

All right

What are you doing? Get in the front

In the death seat?

God i forgot how much i love driving.
I have got to get my licence renewed

What? you don't have valid driver license?
Okay that is it, pull over right now

ross you are so tense. You just gotta relax okay? just need to relax, all right?  just need to relax

What are you are you okay? That's not funny.
just stop horsing around

I am not horsing around okay? I'm porching around

Okay stay calm down, nothing is gonna happen to you, you are not in that much trouble. 

really? you think so?

I was talking to myself. You are going down!
