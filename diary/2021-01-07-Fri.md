Today, I'll continue to talk about my Cebu- Bohol trip.

After we saw the whale shark, we went to the canyoning. Canyoning is a kinds of sport in valley. We went hiking and swimming along the canyon, also diving. 

I had been diving at least 5 times. Whenever I dived, the height got higher. So the last diving was really scary. But I had to do it. Because my girl friend watching me. You know what I'm saying..? 

And there were other Koreans in my group. We were close to each other after the canyoning was done. 

Also I rode a bike in back seat. That's my first rode in bike. It was really speedy and good.
I remember that was really nice tours. 

Another day, we went to the Balicasag hopping tour. The sea's color was crazy! Really beautiful. Also we had a snorkeling and saw the sea turtle!

That was my best trip I've ever been, seriously.
