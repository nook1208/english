# Ross and Rachel dinner with her father

Okay daddy, we'll see you tomorrow night. Okay bye-bye.

We?

Are.. having the dinner with my dad tomorrow night. I hope that's okay.

Oh shoot, tomorrow is not so good. 
I'm supposed to fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. 

Ross, my father doesn't hate you. 

Oh please, he refers to me as 'wet-head'.

Look, He calls everybody by a nickname.

Okay just one dinner all right? Just one night for me plz?

I just want him to love you like I do.

Okay not exactly like i do. But if you come to dinner, i love you like i do in that black thing that you like.

I'll go

Fine

Thank you

Hi gunther

We'll see.

Hi daddy!

This is where they put it? what, there is no table available in the kitchen?

Hello baby

You remember Ross?

Nice to see you again doctor green!

So, how's the library?

Museum.

What happened to the library

There never was library. 
I mean, there are libraries. It's just that i never worked at one

You know what's really good here? The lobster. What do you say, shall i just order 3?

Yeah if you're really hungry.
It was a joke, i made a joke.

Actually dad, Ross is allergic to lobster.

what kind of person is allergic to lobster. i guess the kind of person that works at a library.

It's not a library..
I know it's a museum!

What, Do you think you're the only one around here who can make a joke?. At least mine was funny. Waiter, we will have lobsters and a menu.

So Dr.green how's the old boat?

They found rust. Do you know what rust does to a boat?

It gives it a nice antiquey look?

Rust is boat cancer Ross

Oh i'm sorry. when i was a kid, i lost my bike to that.

Excuse me for a moment, Would you please..
I want to say good night to the Levines before we go.

Okay

Honey stop! It's not that bad!

Wait a minute. I think your father must've added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.

Yeah, That's Daddy.

That's Daddy? but Doesn't it bother you? You are a waitress

Yes. it bothers me ross. If he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers.

So?

Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, He's not gonna change

You really serve people sneezers?

Well I don't

Kids, are you ready?

Yeah Thanks again Dr.green

All right. Oh wait, i think i forgot my receipt

Oh you don't need to that.

Why not?

The carbon is messy. i mean it gets on your fingers and causes the night blindness

What is this, who put twenty down here?

Oh that would be me.

I have a problem I tip way too much, Way way too much. It's a sickness really.

Yeah It is, It is, we have to do something about that.

I know

Excuse me, Do you think I'm cheap?

Oh daddy, He didn't mean anything by that. 
He really didn't.

Nothing I do means anything really.

That's nice. I pay two hundreds dollars for dinner, you put down twenty and you came out looking like Mr. Big Shot.
You really wanna be Mr.Big Shot? I'll tell you what, you pay the whole bill Mr.Big Shot. All right.

Well, Mr.Big Shot is better than 'wet-head'
