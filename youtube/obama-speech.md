# [obama speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7pc2j5OGp8) 
Tonight is a particular honor for me because let's face it.
my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely.
my father was a foreign student born and raised in a small village in Kenya.
he grew up herding goats went to school in a tin roof Shack.
his father, my grandfather was a cook a domestic servant to the British.
but my grandfather had larger dreams for his son.
through hard work and perseverance my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place, America 
that shone as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before.

while studying here, my father met my mother.
she was born in a town on the other side of the world in Kansas 
my parents shared not only an improbable love, they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation.
they would give me an African name, Barack or blessing believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success.
they imagine, they imagine me going to the best schools in the land
even though they weren't rich because in a generous America you don't have to be rich to achieve your potential.

tonight we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation not because of the height of our skyscrapers 
or the power of our military or the size of our economy. 

our pride is based on a very simple premise summed up in a declaration made over 200 years ago 
"we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal 
that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights 
that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness"

that is the true genius of America.  a faith of faith in simple dreams. an insistence on small miracles 
that we can tuck in our children at night and know that they are fed and clothed and safe from harm. 
that we can say what we think, write what we think without hearing a sudden knock on the door.
that we can have an idea and start our own business without paying a bribe.
that we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution 
and that our votes will be counted at least most of the time.

this year in this election, we are called to reaffirm our values and our commitments to hold them against a hard
reality and see how we're measuring up to the legacy of our forbearers and the promise of future generations.

now even as we speak there are those who are preparing to divide us.
the spin masters the negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of "anything goes".
well I say to them tonight there is not a liberal America and a conservative America 
there is the United States of America. 

there is not a black America and a white America and Latino America and Asian America
there's the United States of America.

for a long side are famous individualism, there's another ingredient in the American saga.
a belief that we're all connected as one people.
if there is a child on the southside of Chicago who can't read,
that matters to me even if it's not my child.
if there's a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for their prescription drugs and having to choose between medicine and the rent that makes my life poor even if it's not my grandparent.
if there is an Arab of American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process,
that threaten my civil liberties.

it is that fundamental belief. it is that fundamental belief. 
I am my brother's keeper, I am My Sister's Keeper, that makes this country work.
it's what allows us to pursue our individual dreams and yet still come together as one American family 
"e pluribus unum" out of many one

do we participate in a politics of cynicism or do we participate in a politics of hope? 
John Kerry calls on us to hope, John Edwards calls on us to hope.
I'm not talking about blind optimism here the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't think about it.
where healthcare crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it that's not what I'm talking about.
I'm talking about something more substantial. 

the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs.
the hope of immigrants setting out for different distant shores.
the hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta.
the hope of a mill workers son who dares to defy the odds.
the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him too.
hope in the face of difficulty, hope in the face of uncertainty, the audacity of hope.

in the end that is God's greatest gift to us the bedrock of this nation.
a belief in things not seen.
a belief that their better days ahead 
I believe that we can give our middle-class relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity.
I believe we can provide jobs to the jobless, homes to the homeless and reclaim young people in cities across America from violence and despair.

I believe that we have a righteous wind at our backs and that as we stand on the crossroads of history, we can make the right choices and meet the challenges that face us.

America tonight if you feel the same energy that I do,
if you feel the same urgency that I do,
if you feel the same passion that I do,
if you feel the same hopefulness that I do,
if we do what we must do then I have no doubt.

that all across the country, from Florida to Oregon, from Washington to Maine,
the people will rise up in November and John Kerry will be sworn in as president and John Edwards will be sworn in as vice president and this country will reclaim its promise and out of this long political darkness, a brighter day will come 

thank you very much everybody god bless you. 
thank you.
