I had a second voice call with Rome last night. It's hard to say that I was really good at English that day. But I can say that It was better than the first voice call. 

Because the delay while I made sentences became a little short. Also, I got feedback from my girlfriend. She gave me two kinds of feedback. 
The first thing was about English. She said that I have to use the PC. Because If I didn't remember any words or hard to made sentences, It gonna be helpful to use the dictionary or translator, and take a note those words or sentences.
Plus, She recommended me to request Rome to correct my words or sentences immediately if my words or sentences are wrong. That sounded very good to me. I agree with all of these feedbacks she said.

The second thing was about Korean. She told me that If I told him in Korean, I used to pick difficult words. She said I have to use really easy words and sentences. And, I also agreed. 

So I think the next time voice call'd be better than before.
