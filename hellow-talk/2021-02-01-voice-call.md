Hi

By the way, sorry for canceling last week's voice call. 

Because I had to choose where we stay for our honeymoon.

Oh.. honeymoon 

Honeymoon means, the trip after the wedding right? 

Oh, thank you!

So we decided on three places for our honeymoon. 
and we had a lot of time to define those places.

Define? 

Define yeah, select.

Oh, thank you.

Did you have dinner?

Oh, why did you skip your dinner?

Wow really?

This month? So you started it today? 

Wow, I think you're really hungry right?

When I saw your profile, It didn't look fat.

When I was a high school student, I was really fat. I'm over 100 kilograms. So I know that skipping a meal is really painful. 

How about doing home training? instead of skipping meals.

I think it's nice. You did work out at home and control your eating habit. It's gonna be work.

How can I translate "힘내세요"?

Cheer up and you can do it? Thank you.

I had my meal before this conversation.

I ate pigs feet. 

What does it mean 'pork cut'?

That means so many parts of pigs right?

tenderloin? Oh that means 안심

I mean.. hmm.. It's hard to explain.

That's part of the pig and it's tender meat.

So, I ate pork legs with rice. Also, I cooked a simple dish.

Yeah, I love cooking.

In Korea, there is a lot of people who love cooking. I mean, male. 
And my friends love cooking too.
But he is better than me. Because he uses various types of cooking utensils such as an oven and a steamer.

Do you like cooking?

That's nice. When I go to my parent's house, My mother used to cook. So I can have more free time. 

Not really. When I go to work, the company provides food for every meal times.

But I used to have dinner with my girlfriend at home. 

Cooking is good but there is a little problem.
Cooking spend my time. So on weekdays, I only cook a simple dish. At weekend, I can cook something to spend more my time such as steaks or stew.
